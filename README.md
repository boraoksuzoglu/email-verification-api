## Developer Notes
- These codes are intended to help during the development stage.
In the production, do not use. 
- I am aware that it is not safe to use the ID (generated by Mongoose) as Bearer Token. This is why I wrote the above note.
- I used Yandex to send mails. If you want to use Yandex, there may be a few settings you need to make. [Click here to see the settings](https://yandex.com/support/mail/mail-clients/others.html).
